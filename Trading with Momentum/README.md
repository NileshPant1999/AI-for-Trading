# AI-for-Trading

In this project, We will be implementing a trading strategy on our own, and test to see if it has the potential to be profitable. we will be supplied with a universe of stocks and time range. This project also contains a textual description of how to generate a trading signal based on a momentum indicator. We will then compute the signal for the time range given and apply it to the dataset to produce projected returns. Finally, you will perform a statistical test on the mean of the returns to conclude if there is alpha in the signal. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia.

you can use this by the following simple step

step 1: Change directory to Trading with momentum
        cd/"Trading with Momentum"
        
step 2: open the program in jupyter notebook/ any code editor 
        jupyter notebook
